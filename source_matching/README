This package was written by Alan Meert at the University of Pennsylvania
Department of Physics and Astronomy. The goal of the package is to make 
quick matching between catalogs of sources with given RA/DEC. The goal 
is to ultimately provide support for input redshifts as well.

There are also some utilities provided for matching the catalog to a catalog
stored in a MySQL database.
