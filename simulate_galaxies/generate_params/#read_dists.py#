# TITLE: read_dists 
#
# PURPOSE: reads the cdf distributions
#          for observed magnitude, BT ratio,
#          rad bulge and disk in kpc, bulge
#          ellipticity, bulge sersic index,
#          redshift, zeropoint, kk and airmass
#          sdss parameters. Parameters are randomly
#          selected from this distribtuion.
#
# INPUTS: dist_path: path to the cdf profiles
#         dist_stem: the file stem for the distributions
#
# OUTPUTS: returns mag_dist, bt_dist, re_dist, rd_dist,
#          eb_dist, n_bulge_dist, z_dist, zp_dist, kk_dist,
#          airmass_dist. each of these is a list of arrays of the
#          parameter value and the corresponding cdf value.
