# INSTALLATION

1. In order to install this module, add the directory containing astro\_image\processing to your PYTHONPATH shell variable. 

2. If you are planning to do fitting of galaxies, install Pymorph, SExtractor and Galfit. This project used [SExtractor](http://www.astromatic.net/software/sextractor) version 2.5.0 and [Galfit](http://users.obs.carnegiescience.edu/peng/work/galfit/galfit.html) version 2.0.3c. The Pymorph package is available through [Vinu Vikraman's github](https://github.com/vvinuv/pymorph) and uses version 3.1.1.

3. Then run __create\_user\_params.sh__ 

After this, you should have the minimum needed to use astro\_image\_processing.
